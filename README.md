*Simple diagram showing the general architecture of the current implementation*

## Frontend
The frontend is written using the [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) framework for React. The current implementation uses [`Vercel`](https://vercel.com/) for deployment.

## Backend
The backend consists of an ASP.NET Core API app, a PostgreSQL database and a AWS S3 Bucket for storing images. The current implementation uses Microsoft Azure to deploy both the API app and the Postgre database.
