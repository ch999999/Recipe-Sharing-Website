This is the frontend code repository for a website that users can use to easily create and share recipes (ie. a recipe sharing website). A live implementation is available at https://recipekamu.vercel.app . Instsructions for basic use of the website are found on the [`home page`](https://recipekamu.vercel.app) of the website. The software architecture of the website is explained below.

*Simple diagram showing the general architecture of the current implementation*

## Frontend
The frontend is written using the [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) framework for React. The current implementation uses [`Vercel`](https://vercel.com/) for deployment.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
